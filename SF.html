        <p>Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy (ooh)<br>
        Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (ooh)<br>
        Ayy, ayy<br>
        Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh</p>
        <p>Needless to say, I keep her in check<br>
        She was a bad-bad, nevertheless (yeah)<br>
        Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck (wreck)<br>
        Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck (wreck)</p>
        <p>Needless to say, I'm keeping her in check<br>
        She was all bad-bad, nevertheless<br>
        Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck<br>
        Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck</p>
        <p>Thinkin' in a bad way, losin' your grip<br>
        Screamin' at my face, baby, don't trip<br>
        Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt<br>
        Lookin' at you sideways, party on tilt</p>
        <p>Ooh-ooh-ooh<br>
        Some things you just can't refuse<br>
        She wanna ride me like a cruise<br>
        And I'm not tryna lose</p>
        <p>Then you're left in the dust<br>
        Unless I stuck by ya<br>
        You're the sunflower<br>
        I think your love would be too much<br>
        Or you'll be left in the dust<br>
        Unless I stuck by ya<br>
        You're the sunflower<br>
        You're the sunflower</p>
        <p>Every time I'm leavin' on you (ooh)<br>
        You don't make it easy, no (no, no)<br>
        Wish I could be there for you<br>
        Give me a reason to, oh (oh)</p>
        <p>Every time I'm walkin' out<br>
        I can hear you tellin' me to turn around<br>
        Fightin' for my trust and you won't back down<br>
        Even if we gotta risk it all right now, oh (now)</p>
        <p>I know you're scared of the unknown ('known)<br>
        You don't wanna be alone (alone)<br>
        I know I always come and go (and go)<br>
        But it's out of my control</p>
        And you'll be left in the dust<br>
        Unless I stuck by ya<br>
        You're the sunflower<br>
        I think your love would be too much<br>
        Or you'll be left in the dust<br>
        Unless I stuck by ya<br>
        You're the sunflower<br>
        You're the sunflower (yeah)
