        <p>Need a drink?<br>
        (Hoo, ayy, ayy)<br>
        Found my home (Ooh, ooh)<br>
        She made me leave the thrills at home and I'm fine</p>
        <p>Really think I found my home<br>
        Shorty make me feel at home<br>
        She made me leave the thrills at home<br>
        And I'm fine with it<br>
        She really made me lose control<br>
        I'ma let my love unfold<br>
        We're just two lost souls<br>
        But we're fine with it</p>
        <p>There's love at my front door, short notice<br>
        You're not like the same girls I notice<br>
        Think I met my soul mate<br>
        Yeah, I know it<br>
        When it gets dark outside<br>
        In you I confide<br>
        You help me face my demons<br>
        I won't hide, hide<br>
        Girls like you are hard to find<br>
        I hope you don't mind<br>
        If I give you the time of your life, life, life</p>
        <p>Really think I found my home<br>
        Shorty make me feel at home<br>
        She made me leave the thrills at home<br>
        And I'm fine with it<br>
        She really made me lose control<br>
        I'ma let my love unfold<br>
        We're just two lost souls<br>
        But we're fine with it</p>
        <p>Life is not the same<br>
        With your pictures in my frame<br>
        Now that you're here<br>
        I want nothing to change<br>
        You pick me up when I'm down<br>
        I need you around<br>
        You seen me through my darkest times<br>
        Girl, is there something that you try to find?<br>
        You brought meaning to my life<br>
        All because of you, I do right<br>
        Because of you, I have a purpose<br>
        Fight for the world, because you're worth it</p>
        <p>Really think I found my home<br>
        Shorty make me feel at home<br>
        She made me leave the thrills at home<br>
        And I'm fine with it<br>
        She really made me lose control<br>
        I'ma let my love unfold<br>
        We're just two lost souls<br>
        But we're fine with it</p>
